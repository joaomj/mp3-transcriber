# Project Improvements Summary

## Security Improvements
- Moved API key from form data to Authorization header to prevent logging
- Added file extension validation in addition to MIME type checking
- Added file size limits (100MB per file)
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## Code Quality Improvements
- Added proper logging throughout the application
- Improved error handling with specific exception types
- Added better resource cleanup in finally blocks
- Enhanced file processing with chunked reading to avoid memory issues
- Added validation error collection and reporting

## Architecture Improvements
- Updated pyproject.toml with proper description and dev script
- Updated vercel.json to use Python 3.12
- Improved project documentation in README.md
- Added proper package structure with `__init__.py`

## Error Handling
- Distinguished between errors and exceptions properly
- Added specific handling for different types of OpenAI API errors
- Added validation error collection instead of throwing exceptions for each invalid file
- Added proper resource cleanup in finally blocks

## Frontend Improvements
- Updated JavaScript to send API key in Authorization header
- Added client-side validation for API key format

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- Created comprehensive test suite with 23 unit tests
- Implemented linting with Ruff
- Added type checking with MyPy
- Integrated security scanning with Bandit
- Set up automated code formatting
- Added Makefile for easy execution of all checks
- Created technical documentation in docs/tech-context.md

## Code Refactoring
- Reduced complexity of the main transcription function from 24 to 19 and then to under 10
- Extracted helper functions for better modularity and readability
- Fixed all linting, type checking, and security issues
- Improved code organization and structure

## Test Results
- All 23 unit tests passing
- Security checks passing with no issues
- Type checking passing with no issues
- Code formatting standardized
- No linting errors

## Quality Assurance Tools
- **Linting**: Ruff for code style and error checking
- **Formatting**: Automatic code formatting with Ruff
- **Type Checking**: MyPy for static type checking
- **Security Scanning**: Bandit for security vulnerability detection
- **Testing**: Pytest for unit testing

## Usage
The testing and quality checks can be run using:
```bash
# Run all tests
pdm run test

# Run linting
pdm run lint

# Run formatting
pdm run format

# Run type checking
pdm run type-check

# Run security checks
pdm run security

# Run all checks at once
make all-checks
```

The project now has a robust testing and quality assurance system that ensures code quality, security, and functionality while maintaining the core features of the audio transcription service.
